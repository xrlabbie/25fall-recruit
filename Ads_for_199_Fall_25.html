            <p>This project is for students interested in the intersection of architecture, artificial intelligence, and cognitive neuroscience. The goal is to develop a computational tool that can analyze architectural designs—such as floor plans or 3D models—and predict their cognitive and emotional impact on occupants. This is a chance to apply cutting-edge research in embodied cognition and predictive processing to tangible design problems. Participants will gain hands-on experience in building a novel type of design tool, one that enriches the creative process by providing real-time feedback grounded in cognitive science. This project is ideal for students who want to develop a strong, interdisciplinary portfolio and contribute to a pioneering area of research.</p>

                <p>Our lab is developing a sophisticated, AI-driven website hosted on our own virtual machine. The project's goal is to create an integrated digital environment for our research, far beyond a simple informational site. While the core system is nearly complete, significant work is required to deploy our vast content—including several custom-built encyclopedias—and to integrate a suite of powerful, previously unused applets.</p>
                <p>The student in this role will be central to the site's architecture. Key responsibilities include knowledge management strategy, implementing an intelligent AI-based search system, and integrating our custom applets for tasks like viewing Google Drive files directly on a project page or managing hierarchical FAQs. While we use WordPress for basic content entry by non-programmers, the majority of the site's dynamic functionality is driven by our own programs. This project offers a valuable opportunity to develop practical skills in managing a future-oriented, content-rich web application, making it an excellent addition to a resume or graduate school application.</p>

                <p>This project focuses on the design, development, and testing of an intelligent AI agent capable of auto-grading complex, multimodal student assignments. The primary challenge is to create a system that can evaluate both text-based content from Word reports and visual/structural content from slide presentations. Students in this role will engage with this interdisciplinary problem, blending principles from cognitive science and human-computer interaction into an applied AI system.</p>
                <p>Core tasks will include transforming human rubrics into machine-readable formats, designing the input-output schemas for the AI agent, and rigorously testing how well current AI systems can interpret subjective qualities like creativity and visual appeal alongside structured criteria. This is a research opportunity to work on a tangible system with practical applications: reducing instructor grading time and enhancing the consistency and speed of student feedback. The skills acquired in this project are directly applicable to advanced topics in AI.</p>

                <p class="section-title">Project Description</p>
                 <p>Our research investigates human activity in transitional architectural spaces through high-resolution virtual environments. Creating high-quality architectural / game environments is a detail-demanding process that requires developing custom workflows and acquiring new skillsets for specific challenges. We explore a broad range of areas including 3D scanning, 3D modeling and texturing, lighting and rendering, game development and programming, and data collection through VR tracking sensors. This opportunity is ideal for students interested in VR game development, as the acquired skills can be directly applied to the game development industry.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This project addresses a core challenge in experimental science: designing an interface that is simple enough for a test subject to use under pressure, yet powerful enough for a scientist to configure a complex experiment. Our lab develops numerous cognitive tests, and this role is critical for creating the user interfaces that make this research possible. You will design and build GUIs with distinct "Participant" and "Experimenter" views, managing everything from stimuli presentation to precise data collection.</p>
            <p>This is a unique opportunity to apply UI/UX skills to solve non-trivial design challenges that directly impact the validity of scientific research. The experience of designing for specialized expert users and building robust interfaces for data collection is highly valuable and will result in a portfolio of tangible, impactful projects.</p>

                <p class="section-title">Project Description</p>
                <p>A graphical user interface (GUI) for a cognitive test must serve two very different users simultaneously. The <strong>Participant</strong> needs a clean, intuitive interface that minimizes cognitive load, ensuring we measure their abilities, not their frustration with the UI. The <strong>Researcher</strong>, however, needs a powerful "control panel" to configure the experiment's logic—adjusting trial counts, setting stimuli exposure times in milliseconds, and managing data output.</p>
                <p>You will work directly with cognitive scientists to translate their experimental protocols into seamless and robust user interfaces. Your tasks will include designing and implementing GUIs for a wide range of cognitive tasks (e.g., working memory tests, reaction time tasks), creating the researcher's "control panel," and crafting the focused, aesthetically pleasing interface for test-takers. Your work will have a direct impact on the quality of our scientific research.</p>
                <p class="section-title">Requirements</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experience building user interfaces with a modern framework (Python-based like <strong>Streamlit</strong>, <strong>Tkinter</strong>, or <strong>PyQt</strong> is ideal, but experience with web frameworks like <strong>React/Vue/Svelte</strong> is also highly valued).</li>
                    <li>A strong portfolio or examples demonstrating excellent UI/UX design principles.</li>
                    <li>A passion for user-centered design and solving complex workflow problems.</li>
                    <li>Excellent communication skills to translate scientific requirements into functional design.</li>
